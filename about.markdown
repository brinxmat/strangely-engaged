I'm a software developer working on various projects, mostly web technologies professionally, but I also like to do things with applications and tools. I have been programming since the 1980s, and have worked professionally with software development for the last twenty years. I have worked in various industries, often taking a leading role in understanding domain specifics, which I think is an important part of programming.

Given a number of years of experience, I see that there is always a lot to learn. New ideas turn up and old ideas get rephrased in my mind, and that is what this blog is about — my learning and sharing things that I come across when working with others. Sometimes, what seems natural for me is apparently completely unnatural for people with different backgrounds.

I push for TDD approaches. I believe the main point of TDD is understanding what the problem is and describing this in terms of tests. I try to reflect this in the blog posts, providing an explanation of what we want to achieve, tests and finally the code. Taking this approach hopefully provides an explanation of what we are doing, leaving you to read documentation and implementation code if that interests you.

While relatively language agnostic, I mostly focus professionally on Java, Javascript and Web technologies, but I am also interested in methods and curiosities. I spend a lot of time creating tooling, modelling and generally ensuring that teams know what they need to do and how this can be done given the criteria we have been given.

The blog should hopefully be structured enough that you can find what you need and can ignore the noise.
